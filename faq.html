Both are sweet, creamy, less bitter, very approachable, and great introduction to durian. FIRST-TIMERS who want ADVENTURE: Try Udang Merah (Red Prawn) for unique sweet taste with alcoholic fermentation notes—memorable and different. INTERMEDIATE: Black Thorn offers premium quality with balanced flavor—creamy, sweet with subtle bitter notes, not overwhelming. EXPERIENCED/BOLD: Musang King is the king for a reason—intense bittersweet complexity, rich creamy texture, bright yellow flesh, sophisticated flavor that connoisseurs seek. VALUE: IOI and D13 offer excellent quality at accessible RM18-28/kg pricing. PREMIUM: Musang King and Black Thorn at RM20-45/kg for special occasions. Our team will guide you through selection based on your taste preference—just tell us if you prefer sweet vs bitter, creamy vs firm texture."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "For years we supplied durians to other stalls across Melaka as wholesalers. We noticed a problem: customers didn't know where their durian came from, how it was selected, or when it was harvested. They just trusted the middleman who might mix durians from multiple farms. We believe premium fruit deserves transparency and honest pricing. By opening our retail stall at Melaka Mall in November 2025, we now offer: (1) Direct connection - customers meet the actual farmers, (2) Same-day harvest - fruit picked and sold within hours, (3) Full transparency - you know exactly which farm (ours in Bukit Serampang) and which trees your durian came from, (4) Better prices - no middleman markup means more value for customers, (5) Quality guarantee - only our carefully selected durians, no mixing with unknown sources, (6) Education - we can share our three generations of durian farming knowledge directly. This is our mission: make premium durian accessible at honest prices with complete transparency."
